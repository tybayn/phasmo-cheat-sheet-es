# Unofficial Phasmo Cheat Sheet (template)

A client facing web-app guide for the horror video game Phasmophobia. This repo is intended to be forked and translated into other languages.

In order to make this version work with other languages, the following features from the original have been removed:
- Discord Link
- News feed
- Live updating ghost data
- Live event data

The proprietary backend servers for the Unofficial Phasmo Cheat Sheet are in english only and cannot be translated correctly on the fly. As such, these versions of the website will contain static json files with the needed data that will need to be maintained by other community members that have the ability to translate.

## Copyright Notice

This repository may contain some left over assets from Phasmophobia (used with permission) that are needed for this website to run. These assets are excluded from the license and may not be used without permission from Kinetic Games. 

This bare-bones version of the site will also be missing any files that are not explicitly open source. This means that footstep sounds have been changed to a open source, attribution free sound and specific ghost noises have been removed.
